    <img src="../img/spaghetti.jpeg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This scallop pasta dinner with a creamy sauce is fast and easy. i cook the <br>
    scallops a bit longer than many chefs, but that gives the dish more flavor and <br>
they're still tender and. I think you'll agree, the sherry sauce benefits <br>
significantly from the longer cook time. </p>

<h3>ingredient</h2>
<ul>
    <li>8 ounces uncooked thick Spaghetti</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 pound bay scallops</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>2 teaspoon granted lemon zest</li>
    <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes</li>
    <li>1/3 cup dry sherry</li>
    <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
    <li>salt and pepper to taste </li>
    <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons chopped italian parsley, divided</li>
    <li>Freshly granted Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese,for serving</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling<br> water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes or<br> 1 minute less than directed on the package.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. When oil just starts to <br>smoke, add scallops and move them into a single layer. Let sear on high for <br>about 1 minute. Toss to turn.</li>
    <li>Add butter and stir scallops until butter melts. Stir in garlic</li>
</ol>
